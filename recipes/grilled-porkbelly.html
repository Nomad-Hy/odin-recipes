        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p><strong>Samgyeopsal</strong> is a popular Korean dish made from the pork belly, which is the abdominal part of the pig. It features layers of fat and meat, offering a juicy and tender texture. Typically seasoned with just <strong><em>salt and pepper</em></strong>, it is grilled over charcoal or a gas stove. It is usually enjoyed wrapped in lettuce leaves with various accompaniments like <strong><em>garlic, ssamjang (a savory dipping sauce)</em></strong>, and chili peppers. While delicious on its own, these additions enhance its rich flavor even more.</p>
